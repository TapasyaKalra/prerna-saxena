Therapy takes time and Prerna knows how to make it a space that is the best for you. I felt safe, heard, supported and in touch with my emotions - some things I hadn't felt for a long time before I came to therapy with Prerna. I recommend it!",

			"I have tried therapy several times before but it never helped me. But I really needed help as I was going through a tough time, so I decided to give it one more go, and I am glad that I did that! Ms Prerna really helped me with practices that are beneficial for me in controlling and dealing with my anger issues. With her suggestions and guidance, I am able to work better on problems and focus on my mental health in more practical ways. She was very good in terms of patiently listening and understanding what I was going through, she helped me understand myself better. I am so thankful and grateful that I found her and decided to give therapy one more chance!",
